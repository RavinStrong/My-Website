        <p>Horror is a genre of storytelling that is meant to shock, scare and thrill its audience. Horror as its own
            genre is quite broad.
            Here I will breakdown the main sub-genres that make up horror
        </p>

            <h2 id="slasher_title">Slasher</h2><!--TITLES WITH ID TO CENTER IN CSS-->
            <p>A slasher is a genre of horror almost exclusively found in film where a killer stalks a group of people
                and murders them, usually with sharp tools.
                This specific subgenre has many tropes that may exist in other subgenres but are typical of slashers.
                The villains of a slasher are almost always human; commonly
                , they were also once victims of some past violence. This is the “explanation” of why the killer acts as
                they do. Another genre trope is the “final girl”; the final girl is the last
                woman standing who typically defeats or unmasks the killer. While final girls can be found throughout
                horror, they are most famously a part of slashers.
                While slashers do tend to have violent scenes, they usually are not very gory; however, that can change
                depending on the film.</p>

        <div id="psychological_info">
            <h2 id="psych_title">Psychological</h2>
            <p>Psychological horror is a subgenre that explores a character's mental and psychological states.
                Psychological horror can also be referred to as a thriller; it aims to create suspense throughout the
                story, resulting in a climax.
                A common trope is that these stories seek to disturb their viewers by focusing on a character who loses
                grasp on reality, revealing them as outsiders,
                leaving the narrator unsettled, and questioning everything they know about the story. Psychological
                horror is rarely gory; if there is any gore, it is generally during
                the climactic ending. Psychological horror is often paired with other genres like supernatural, creating
                its own unique subgenre with its own tropes</p>

            <h2 id="super_title">Supernatural</h2>
            <p>Supernatural horror it's pretty self-explanatory; it's a subgenre that revolves around supernatural
                occurrences.
                This includes anything to do with ghosts, the afterlife, devils or demons. This subgenre has been around
                for centuries.
                There are tales dating back hundreds of years that are about the supernatural. Supernatural horror is
                often paired with other sub genres like thriller or body
                horror..</p>

        <div id="body_info">
            <h2 id="body_title">Body Horror</h2>
            <p>Body horror or biological horror is a subgenre that is focused on the grotesque and gore. Gore refers to
                violence or bloodshed, while gore is often found in
                body horror. It is not always a requirement. Body horror also includes mutated, deformed, or manipulated
                human bodies or other creatures.
                The grotesque nature of these films can make the audience feel disturbed and sometimes disgusted, though
                the audience's reaction is based on the level
                of body horror in the story. Many believe body horror is a genre that is "gore for the sake of gore." It
                is often just a representation of the commentary an author or
                director is trying to make. Commonly, changing a character's physical body is often a representation of
                something internally going on with a character, like
                moral corruption or something similar. These physical changes are also often a representation of a
                commentary on class, race, or society.</p>
