            <h2>The Epic of Gilgamesh</h2>
            <p> In ancient Mesopotamia, it was believed that all illness and misfortune was caused by hauntings,
                creating a slew of stories that lend themselves to the horror genre.
                In the famous story, a king named Gilgamesh is challenged by a warrior. Once Gilgamesh defeats this
                warrior, Enkidu, They travel around completing various tasks, such as slaying the guardian of the
                legendary Cedar Forest.
                They even kill the “Bull of Heaven.” This insults one of their goddesses, and she sentences Enkidu to
                death. This epic tale of monsters, gods, and even murderous humans is considered one of the oldest
                horror stories. </p>
            <h2>The Horrors of Ancient Greece</h2>
            <p> Many of us are familiar with ancient Greek stories, whether about their many gods, monsters, or
                demigods. But many of these stories are considered the great-great-great grandfathers of horror.
                The story of Oedipus is a great example. Oedipus is determined to find a kingslayer, unaware throughout
                his journey that he IS the kingslayer;
                he even marries the windowed queen without realizing she is his birth mother, which sounds like a
                psychological horror to me. </p>
            <h2> An Ancient Egyptian Ghost Story</h2>
            <p>
                “Ghost Story” is an ancient Egyptian tale dating back to 1880 CE, while some scholars disagree on
                some details of the story.
                The main plot is about a high priest who spends a night in the necropolis, where he encounters
                a spirit who is restless because his tomb is falling apart.
                After that night, the priest gathers a group to find where he is buried in hopes of
                restoring his tomb. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is lost, so we do not know how it ends.
                However, this tale of a restless spirit is nothing short of ghostly horror.
