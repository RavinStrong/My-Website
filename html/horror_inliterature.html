   <h2>Frankensteirn by Mary Shelly </h2>
   
   <p>PsychMary Shelly's Frankenstein has inspired horror media for over two centuries. Frankenstein is simultaneously a gothic novel and the first science fiction novel in history. 
      It was an early warning of what horrors could meet us if science and technology went too farâ€”a widespread trope by today's standards but revolutionary in 1818.
       Mary Shelly originally came up with Frankenstein while competing in a competition between friends. 
       While on a trip in 1816, Lord Byron proposed a contest to his friends. Everyone writes a horror story, reads it aloud, and they'll vote on a winner well. 
       Mary Shelley won the competition and created one of the most influential stories in history. </p>

   <h2>The Fall of The House of The Usher by Edgar Allen Poe</h2>
  
   <p>Edgar Allen Poe is one of the first writers in America to popularize the scary, dark, and macabre. He is famous for many of his works, like his poem "The Raven,"
       but one of his most influential works is The Fall of The House of The Usher. This short gothic horror story is significant because it explores the supernatural and
        psychological. The story is about the unnamed narrator arriving at his friend Rodrick Usher's home. Once he arrives, he sees the home is in disarray and seemingly falling apart. 
        The house represents the Usher family as the Usher family is an aristocratic family with a "Pure" lineage; however, that cannot save them from their grizzly end. 
        This short story has inspired many other horror works throughout history (and is my favorite:)
