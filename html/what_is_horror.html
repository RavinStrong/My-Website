    <h2>Definition of horrorr</h2>

    <h2>Horror misconceptions</h2>
    <p>
        One common misconception of horror is that it is similar or akin to true crime. True crime is a soecific genre that is based of real events telling the stories of real victims and real perpetrators.
        While some horror has been loosly inspired by true events, horror is explicitly fictitious. When it comes to true crime there is often ethical concerns about exploiting victims and their families or even 
        idiolizing relal criminals. In horror this is not the case even when fans seem to "idiolize" a villian it s a fictitious character who caused no real harm.

    Another popular misconception is all horror has to be gory. While yes gore  will alwasy be connected to the genre of horror. It is easy to make a book,movie or any othe piece of horror media without 
    gore. I WILL CONTINUE EXPLAINING FURTHER BUT I NEED FILLER TO DEMONSTRATE THE COLUMNSS
